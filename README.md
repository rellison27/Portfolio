# Portfolio

This is a simple project I completed to demonstrate my abillity to duplicate a design created by a designer. I 
used html, css, and boostrap.

# Install
- `$ Git clone https://github.com/rellison27/Portfolio.git`
-  Or click the green download button. Then unlock all the files to open

# Check it out

Once all of the files are downloaded. Open the pdf to see the mock-up created by the designer.
After careful inspection open
```
test.html
```
in your browser of choice and see that I created the exact same layout.
